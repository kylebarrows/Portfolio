# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio!

I have two projects here: a physics engine and a game I made from scratch.

The physics engine was made as an attempt for me to relearn physics and practice solving programming challenges beyond typical classwork. This physics engine uses impulse based physics to solve collisions and has friction and angular velocity. This engine also uses a version of the sweep and prune algorithmn to handle the broadphase. Additionally, it uses a testbed made with SFML. My future work with this project will delve into better memory managment and allocation strategies. 

The game was inspired by some game I found on the Apple app store called "Wall Kickers" by Kumobis. This is a game I enjoy to play in duller moments like waiting at the bus stop. I felt this game would be a good challenge while also reasonably scoped to learn about Entity Component Systems and how they work. This game only has one control, the spacebar to jump from the wall or double jump in the air. Try to reach as high as possible!

Thank you,
Kyle Barrows
