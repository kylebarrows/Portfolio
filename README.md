# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio!

The physics engine is a 2D physics engine with impulse based physics, collision detection, and has friction and angular velocity. It uses a testbed made with SFML.

The game was inspired by some game I found on the Apple app store called "Wall Kickers" by Kumobis. This is a game I enjoy to play in duller moments like waiting at the bus stop. I felt this game would be a good challenge while also reasonably scoped to learn about Entity Component Systems and how they work. This game only has one control, the spacebar to jump from the wall or double jump in the air. You can hold it to jump for longer. Also features some procedural generation for nearly endless runs. Try to reach as high as possible!

Thank you,
Kyle Barrows
