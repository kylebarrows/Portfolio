# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio!

The physics engine is a 2D rigid body simulation with impulse based physics, collision detection, friction forces, and angular velocity. It uses a testbed made with SFML.
 
This game only has one control, the spacebar to jump from the wall or double jump in the air. You can hold it to jump for longer. Also features some procedural generation for nearly endless runs. Try to reach as high as possible!
